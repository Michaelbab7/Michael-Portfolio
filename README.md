# [Sales Analysis](https://github.com/Michaelbab7/Michael-Portfolio/blob/main/Sales%20Analysis.ipynb)
## Set of real world data analyst tasks completed using the Python Pandas library.
#### Cleaning the data:
* Drop NaN values from DataFrame
* Removing rows based on a condition
* Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)

####  Explore 5 high level business questions related to our data:
* What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
* What city sold the most product?
* What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
* What products are most often sold together?
* What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?

#### In order to answer these questions i used many different pandas & matplotlib methods. They include:
* Concatenating multiple csvs together to create a new DataFrame (pd.concat)
* Adding columns
* Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str)
* Using the .apply() method
* Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis
* Plotting bar charts and lines graphs to visualize our results
* Labeling our graphs
